    <h2>Rollercoaster Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The funfair is in town and presents its newest maglev-powered rollercoaster. But they wanted to save
      money, so they have chosen the cheapest option and now it is starting to break down.
    </p>
    <p> And someone is still on the rollercoaster!!
    </p>
    <p>
      You are the rollercoaster operator and you control the magnets. You can either turn them on or off and you can
      accelerate and brake the car on the track only if the magnets are switched on. Sometimes you will be in a dilemma
      and will have to decide whether or not to disable the magnets to let the car jump over missing tracks.
    </p>
    <h3>CONTROLS</h3>
    <p><strong>SPACE</strong> - enable/disable maglev/maglock<br/>
      <strong>A/D or left/right</strong> - accelerate/brake if the car is on the track and maglev is active
